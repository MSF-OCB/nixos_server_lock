To build, run
```
  nix build
```

When changing the Elm dependencies, the Nix build needs to be re-generated by running the following command in the `frontend` directory
```
  ./generate-nix-build
```

Once built, the server can be started using
```
  ./result/bin/nixos_panic_button --lock_script "./lock.sh" --verify_script "./verify.sh" --disable_targets "localhost:8000"
```
